Anna Olson Bake With Anna Olson. This snack, courtesy of Anna Olson, is complete with oatmeal raisin cookies and a peanut buttery filling and will delight young and old alike. These cookies are unlike any traditional oatmeal raisin cookie you&#39;ve had- they&#39;re incredibly chewy, sticky, and sweet but hold their shape just as a regular cookie would. I love the combination between the chewiness to the crunch and freshness of the apple slice if you choose to make these a sandwich.

These cookies are unlike any traditional oatmeal raisin cookie you&#39;ve had- they&#39;re incredibly chewy, sticky, and sweet but hold their shape just as a regular cookie would. I love the combination between the chewiness to the crunch and freshness of the apple slice if you choose to make these a sandwich. The oatmeal cookies I used for these sandwiches were very soft and moist. There is butter in the recipe, but I also added a fair amount of applesauce to ensure that they stayed moist. Because the cookies are sweet, I didn&#39;t want to mix up any old frosting combination and slap it into the sandwiches.
